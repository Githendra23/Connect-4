# Connect-4-in-C

This is a simple Connect 4 game coded in C language. 

My version of the game has colours for each player 


GENERAL USE NOTES
-----------------

- Choose a number between 1 and 7.
- Choosing otherwise will prompt you to try again (typing a letter will not give you a warning it will enter a number you have previously entered, if you have not entered anything before then entering a letter will do nothing).
- You can win either by connecting four horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
- Enjoy!
